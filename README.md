# MAD_L00NIX_SCRIPTZ
Some random scripts for Linux distros that I use. Mainly Arch and Alpine.

# Arch
alhp.sh - Automaticly adds Chaotic-AUR and ALHP (choose between x86_64 v3 and v4) to Arch Linux.

# Podman
podman_purger.sh - Purge all stopped/unused stuff from podman alogside with their leftovers.
