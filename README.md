# About
This is just a random repo of my stuff that needs to be online at all times.
Mainly for scripts and maybe some dotfiles in the future.
I won't explain in detail what the scripts available here do.
They're meant to be simple, yet useful. At least for me.
If you want to use them, read them first and understand what they do!

## Add useful repos to Arch Linux
 This command will add Chaotic-AUR and ALHP (x86_64-v3 or v4) repos to Arch. Run this command as root. I'd recommend doing that during installation of Arch and then in freshly
 installed system to make sure that you have packages compiled for your CPU level.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirbisz666/MAD_L00NIX_SCRIPTZ/refs/heads/main/scripts/alhp.sh && chmod +x alhp.sh && ./alhp.sh
```
