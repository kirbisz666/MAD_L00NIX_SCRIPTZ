# About
This is just a random repo of my stuff that needs to be online at all times.
Mainly for scripts and maybe some dotfiles in the future.
I won't explain in detail what the scripts available here do.
They're meant to be simple, yet useful. At least for me.
If you want to use them, read them first and understand what they do!
